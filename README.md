# Somvan team's Roblox Exploits
## Search for any roblox script you want! 
Our team already prepared some fresh and undetected scripts! 
## Orion Library
Our scripts are using Orion UI Library. 
Here is Orion documentation: https://github.com/shlexware/Orion/blob/main/Documentation.md. 
## Script doesn't work!
If some functions of some scripts or whole script doesn't work, that usually means vulnerability is detected and fixed. 
Tell us about this to make us find more undetected vulnerabilities and implement them. 
## I can't find my game!
If you can't find your game inside avaible scripts, that usually means we haven't made script for that game. 
You can suggest a game for us to make script, though, it must have at least 10K visits. 
## When Exploit is gonna come out?
We are currently doing hard work on our exploit HijeXPloit with custom dll. 
Since Roblox has updated anti-cheat, we had to reprogram ENTIRE dll!
